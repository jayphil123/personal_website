            <p>I am currently a student at the University of Michigan studying Computer Science. I've been a part of
                a few project teams here including Spark and M-Rover. I've also had a lot of experience working through many different
                challenging but rewarding classes. These include Web Systems, Programming Paradigms, User Interface Development, Computer Science Pragmatics,
                Data Structures and Algorithms, Intro to Computer Organization, and Web Design, Development, and Accessibility.
