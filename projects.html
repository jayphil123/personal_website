            <h2>Lighting Controller Software Tester</h2>
            <p>This was my first real project as an intern at ITC Inc. I was tasked with creating a full stack controller software tester to test
               the many commands of ITC's lighting controllers. The tester could be run on up to 15 different lighting controllers and tested functionality
               for both CAN and Bluetooth communication. The tester also comes with a physical testing box with 3 types of lights (rgb, rgbw, and argb). The box
               contained a camera at the top which paired with the software checked to see if the lights matched the commands given to the lighting controller.
               The front end design allowed users to import tests, swap the order of tests, and select which tests to run for the given suite.

            <h2>Nissan Light Bar Tester</h2>
            <p>Another unique project I got to work on at ITC Inc. was a Nissan Light Bar Tester. This was another full stack testing application
                that took in an image of the resulting light from our Nissan Light Bar's, ran a series of tests on the image measuring focus, brightness,
                angles, and size of the letters/logos, and produced either a pass or fail in the GUI that was paired with it. The tester also logged all of
                the information from the tests into an excel sheet that the production team could use to understand what went wrong with the light bar.

            <h2>Scheme Metacircular Evaluator</h2>
            <p>This was one of the more conceptual projects I have ever worked on, a Scheme evaluator written in Scheme. Some of the core learning
                concepts from this project were focusing on recursion, higher-order functions, and functional data abstraction along with differences between
                static and dynamic scope. The most important thing I was able to learn from this project, however, was reading and fully understanding a spec
                for a language.

            <h2>Instagram Clone</h2>
            <p>Insta 485 was the culmination of a project my group put together over the course of half a semester. The project entailed 
                a full stack development of an Instagram clone where users could create password protected accounts, comment and like on posts,
                and import posts themselves. This was all hosted on an AWS account as well. The primary skills I learned from this project
                was asynchronous programming, working with API's SQL databases, and creating security with hashable passwords.
