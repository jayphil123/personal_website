            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>I am currently a student at the University of Michigan studying Computer Science. I've been a part of
                a few project teams here including Spark and M-Rover. I've also had a lot of experience working through many different
                challenging but rewarding classes. These include Web Systems, Programming Paradigms, User Interface Development, Computer Science Pragmatics,
                Data Structures and Algorithms, Intro to Computer Organization, and Web Design, Development, and Accessibility.

            <h2>Sports</h2>
            <p>Whether I'm watching or playing, count me in when it comes to sports. I've been playing an organized sport since I was
                four years old and I don't plan on stopping anytime soon. Nowadays, I usually can be seen playing basketball, golf, or any form of
                backyard game. I'm a diehard Detroit sports fan as well, repping the Lions in the fall and the Pistons/Tigers in the Spring/Summer. And 
                of course as a Michigan student I love watching the wolverines in Football, Basketball, and Hockey.

            <h2>Music</h2>
            <p>I had over 100,000 minutes of music listened to on Spotify last year. To me, music can describe emotions better
                than any other art form through a combination of spoken word and beautiful instrumentals. The main genres I tend to listen
                to are Rap, Indie Rock, and Classic Rock. Some of my favorite artists include Pink Floyd, Mac Demarco, Tame Impala, Kid Cudi,
                Kendrick Lamar, Baby Keem, and Tyler, The Creator.

            <h2>Video Games</h2>
            <p>Ever since 2011 I've had access to some form of a Playstation starting with the PS3. Video games were a big part
                of my childhood and something I've carried into my young adult life. Some of my most played games are Smite, Minecraft, and Fortnite
                but my favorites are Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Elden Ring, God of War Ragnar√∂k, and Uncharted 3.
