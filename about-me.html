            <h2>Sports</h2>
            <p>Whether I'm watching or playing, count me in when it comes to sports. I've been playing an organized sport since I was
                four years old and I don't plan on stopping anytime soon. Nowadays, I usually can be seen playing basketball, golf, or any form of
                backyard game. I'm a diehard Detroit sports fan as well, repping the Lions in the fall and the Pistons/Tigers in the Spring/Summer. And 
                of course as a Michigan student I love watching the wolverines in Football, Basketball, and Hockey.
